# CSCI 4900/6900: Practical WiFi Localization and Sensing Project

## 1. Localization

This project is based on DLoc MobiCom 2020 dataset and codebase. The original repository can be found [here](https://github.com/ucsdwcsng/DLoc_pt_code).

In this repo, we give some codes to help you understand how DLoc preprocess the raw CSI data to get the AoA-ToF images. Please see the `Localization` folder for more details.

## 2. Sensing

This project is based on Widar3.0 TPAMI 2021 dataset and codebase. The original repository and datasets can be found [here](https://tns.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/widar3.0/).

Here we provide some codes to help you preprocess the raw CSI dataset to a usable format and give you some demo models to train and test. Please see the `Sensing` folder for more details.
